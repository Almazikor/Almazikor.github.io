				Storyline
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 18px">Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner. <br> Gardner has invested heavily in a device known as a "bone density <br>scanner". He feels like he has it made selling these devices. However, they do not <br>sell well as they are marginally better than x-ray at a much higher price. As Gardner <br>works to make ends meet, his wife leaves him and he loses his apartment. Forced to <br>live out in the streets with his son, Gardner continues to sell bone density <br>scanners while concurrently taking on an unpaid internship as a stockbroker, with slim <br> chances for advancement to a paid position. Before he can receive pay, he needs <br>to outshine the competition through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices <br>to stay afloat.</p>
